Here will be replices of each other

1:
Above the orchard the beetles hum,
Still singing, the girls homeward come,
The tired plowmen's steps grow slower,
And mothers with supper wait at home.

2:
Close by the house they eat their supper;
Just then the evening-star appears;
As daughter serves. Her mother cares
To teach to do things in ways proper.
The nightingale's song interferes.

3:
Close to the wall on the clay-benches
The mother lulls her Nell and Bill,
And falls asleep ... But the sweet wenches
And nightingales are singing still.

4:
not yet
